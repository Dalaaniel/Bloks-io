# **App Name**: Tetris Canvas

## Core Features:

- Horizontal Canvas: Create a horizontally scrollable canvas that will act as the main area.
- Tetris Block Store: Implement a store where users can purchase different Tetris blocks. 
- Drag and Drop: Enable drag and drop functionality to allow users to place purchased Tetris blocks onto the canvas.
- 2D Physics: Integrate basic 2D physics to allow blocks to interact realistically with the canvas.
- Canvas auto-extension: The canvas will extend itself as the users places the objects near the borders

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Blue (#4285F4) for a clean and modern look, inspired by classic Tetris.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) to ensure good contrast with the Tetris blocks.
- Accent color: Yellow (#FFEB3B) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif for a clean, neutral user interface.
- Use simple, outlined icons for store items and UI controls.
- The canvas should have a clean and uncluttered layout, with clear visual separation between the blocks and the background.
- Use smooth transitions and subtle animations for drag and drop interactions.
